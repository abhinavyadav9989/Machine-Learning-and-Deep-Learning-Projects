The manual interpretation of MRI scans for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis is a complex and time-consuming task that heavily relies on the expertise of trained radiologists. 

The subjective nature of visual interpretation can introduce variations and lead to diagnostic inaccuracies. Additionally, the growing number of MRI scans and the shortage of expert radiologists pose challenges for timely and widespread Alzheimer's disease detection. To address these challenges, there is a need for an automated and reliable system that can accurately detect Alzheimer's disease using MRI scans. Deep Learning, a subfield of machine learning, has shown remarkable potential in image analysis tasks. Leveraging the power of Deep Learning algorithms can help extract meaningful features from MRI scans and develop robust models capable of accurate Alzheimer's disease detection.
Therefore, the problem statement for this project is to design and develop an automated system that utilizes Deep Learning techniques to analyze MRI scans and accurately detect Alzheimer's disease. The system should be able to preprocess MRI 
images, extract relevant features, train a Deep Learning model on labeled datasets, and provide reliable classification results. The developed system should demonstrate high accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in Alzheimer's disease detection, while also being efficient, user-friendly, and scalable to handle large volumes of MRI data. By addressing this problem, we aim to provide healthcare professionals with a powerful tool that can assist in early diagnosis, enable proactive interventions, and improve the overall management of Alzheimer's disease. The automated detection system has the potential to enhance the efficiency of clinical workflows, reduce the burden on radiologists, and ultimately contribute to better patient care and outcomes in the battle against Alzheimer's disease.
